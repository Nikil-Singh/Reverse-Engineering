Upon running the actual algorithm, the algorithm seems to be a type of sort.
Looking at the disassembled code, there seems to be multiple sets of loops.
Some of the loops seemed to be for scanning input and outputting the data
after being sorted. Also, it seems like for the algorithm there are two sets
of loops. On top of that it seems like it is a set of nested loops. This lead
me to believe it is a sorting algorithm of time complexity N^2. This is made
evident as two different variables are incremented by 1 on each iteration. This
leads limits the number of sorting algorithms to be bubble, selection and 
insertion sort. Beyond this I cannot tell any further which algorithm was used.
If a guess had to be made, I would guess bubble as that tends to be the most 
common basic sorting algorithm most people would implement.
