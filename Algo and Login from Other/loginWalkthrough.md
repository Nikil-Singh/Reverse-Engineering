Upon opening it as assembly, I found the string "O2dl+".
I also found when running the program it would output a slightly
altered string compared to the input I placed. There was also a function
called encryption. My first guess was it was some sort of caesar cipher.
I then tested more outputs and realised the value of the output was one less
on the ASCII table. I then looked up the appropriate ASCII values and found
the corresponding values to be "N1ck*" surprisingly. It then also outputted
the flag flag{O2dl+}.
