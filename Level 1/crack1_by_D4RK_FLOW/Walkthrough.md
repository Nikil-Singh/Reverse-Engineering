The first reverse engineering exercise I’ve undertaken does have a walkthrough 
so I could learn how reverse engineering works. Looking at the disassembled 
code we can see there are a set of if statements. Those if statements seem to 
compare an input for a password letter by letter. The password ends up being 
“H1DD3N”.
