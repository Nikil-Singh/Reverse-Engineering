Upon inspection of the disassembled code, it is clear that it checks for a
string of length 7. After a lot of reseaching on what different commands
and register mean I found two variables. They contained the letters dec, k, car. 
I quickly realised thats an anogram for cracked. 'cracked' is also a 7 letter
word. I entered the password and I was correct.
